# Length Converter using Js

A simple web-based length converter built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.



## ðŸš€ Features
- Convert between meters, feet, inches, and more
- Simple and clean UI using Tailwind CSS
- Responsive design for all devices

## What I learned:
- I learnt how to use **TailwindCSS** properly to create responsive designs.
TailwindCSS is a component library for css which basically has pre-defined class components for all styles. So for width we use w-1 which is equal to the CSS style of
 {width:0.25rem/4px}. Which when stacked with multiple styles saves tons of time.

 - I also got started with version control. I look forward to adding better projects in future

 - Finally **javascript** functions like *forEach* which are really cool.Btw forEach func. is used to callback function/s for a nodelist/array. It's like the uncle of for of loop but cooler.
